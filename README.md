# EverTree Vault

**Preserving Knowledge for Humanity's Future**

EverTree Vault is a decentralized knowledge repository designed to safeguard critical information against censorship, manipulation, and loss—ensuring that truth remains accessible for future generations.

---

## 🌱 Key Features

- **Censorship Resistant**  
  Utilizes decentralized storage to prevent any single entity from altering or removing content.

- **Permanent Archives**  
  Ensures long-term preservation of information through immutable data structures.

- **Decentralized Truth**  
  Leverages distributed networks to maintain the integrity and availability of knowledge.

---

## 🧠 The Problem

### Knowledge Under Threat

Critical information is increasingly vulnerable to suppression by powerful entities.  
For instance, as of 2022, internet freedom has declined for 12 consecutive years, with only 31% of the world experiencing a free internet environment.

### Real-World Impact

The disappearance of crucial information can lead to:

- Skewed historical narratives favoring those in power.
- Hindered scientific progress when research contradicts corporate interests.
- Weakened democracies due to lack of reliable governmental information.
- Loss of cultural heritage when digital content policies change arbitrarily.

### Why Current Solutions Fail

Traditional archives, cloud storage, and basic blockchain solutions have significant weaknesses, such as vulnerability to physical destruction, centralized control, and susceptibility to institutional biases.

---

## 🎯 Target Audience

- **Journalists & Whistleblowers** – Need a tamper-proof platform to store revelations and evidence.
- **Researchers & Academics** – Require permanent archives for their discoveries and data.
- **Privacy Advocates** – Seek decentralized solutions for information sovereignty and digital rights.
- **Decentralized Thinkers** – Aim to build systems beyond centralized control and single points of failure.

---

## 🚀 Why This Matters

In an era of increasing digital control and content erasure, the ability to preserve unaltered information is critical. This project isn't just about storage—it's about trust, longevity, and the protection of truth. EverTree Vault gives power back to individuals and communities by ensuring their knowledge is never lost or silenced.

## ⚙️ Technical Development

EverTree Vault is built with:

- **Next.js & TypeScript** – For a performant and scalable frontend.
- **ICP SDK** – Integrates directly with the Internet Computer Protocol to utilize its decentralized storage and compute capabilities.
- **TailwindCSS & Framer Motion** – For responsive, animated, and accessible design.
- **TSParticles** – To enhance visual experience with subtle particle effects depending on dark/light mode.

We’ve abstracted away complexity to make future development, integration with agents, and collaboration seamless.
